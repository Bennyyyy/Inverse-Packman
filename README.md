"Manpac" is controllable by the cursors keys or a controller (left analog stick). The ghosts are controlled by click-and-draging a ghost which sets their target.

## About
*Manpac vs. Ghostman* was created during the [SEITENBAU Hackathon 2019](https://hackathon.seitenbau.com), a "[GameJam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam)". Within ~1 day we prototyped the idea "Wouldn't it be fun to play Pacman™ from the other perspecttive - as the ghosts?" And, as it turns out - it actually is!

The code is horribly written, the game terribly buggy but the core gameplay loop is very fun! And that's we wanted to accomplish in the short time span. :)
